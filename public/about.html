<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Geggalapally Sadhwika. After completing my secondary schooling with a CGPA of 9.0, I pursued the science stream in
  my senior secondary and secured 89.1%. Then, I joined in Bachelor of Engineering in
  Information Technology program at Neil Gogte Institute of Technology and graduated with a
  CGPA of 7.8. The course work helped me to develop mastery in the modules like Programming, Data Structures, Web Development, Operating Systems, Database
  Systems, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Design and Analysis of Algorithms,
  Machine Learning, Big Data Analytics, and Cloud Computing.</p>

<p>I have completed two projects, one is on a driverâ€™s drowsiness detection system, the project is a
  car safety technology that helps prevent accidents caused by drivers getting drowsy and the
  other project is on Automatic Fake Currency Recognition System, which is designed to detect
  the counterfeit paper currency to check whether it is fake or original.
  I have completed my internship with Exposys data labs on Diabetes prediction using machine
  learning models. The motive of this study is to design a model which can prognosticate the
  likelihood of diabetes in patients with maximum accuracy.</p>

<p>My short-term goal during the course is to enhance my problem-solving and programming skills.
  Upon the successful completion of coursework, I intend to gain industrial exposure through my
  efforts in internship activities. The intention is to sync my skills to the industrial functionalities.
  Upon the duration of the internship, I intend to establish my career in the
  designation of software developer in global companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. The
  course will help me to accomplish high-paying job opportunities. In the mentioned way, the
  coursework and the admission will help me to implement my aspirations. If given the
  opportunity through admission, I will leverage my efforts to fruitfully prove that I am a worthy
  pick.</p>
